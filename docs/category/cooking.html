			<h2>To do:</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Fix the title link -- make it more obvious that the title is a link/button.</li>
<li>[ ] Fix the GVS pdf link on the coursework page</li>
<li>[x] Download some package to render LaTeX and the LaTeX logo in markdown -- <a href="https://nosferalatu.com/Pelican.html">https://nosferalatu.com/Pelican.html</a></li>
<li>[ ] Fix the footer -- <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/</a></li>
<li>[x] Fix the image height issue -- the image should not stretch and squeeze with the text, and the text should wrap around the image</li>
<li>[x] Make the footer appear at the end of the body content, needs to be done in CSS.</li>
<li>[ ] Figure out a way to format inline code -- there is probably just a language specifier for this.</li>
<li>[ ] Changing colors randomly from a list in CSS <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25507496/css-change-text-color-randomly">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25507496/css-change-text-color-randomly</a></li>
<li>[ ] Make the website available through google search <a href="https://victor2code.github.io/blog/2019/07/04/jekyll-github-pages-appear-on-Google.html">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49073043/get-github-pages-site-found-in-google-search-results">here</a></li>

<h2>Hello world!</h2>
<p>This website is an experiment that I undertook because I was curious about web development.
I wanted to make a website that had the aesthetic of old websites from around the time the internet was born.
I liked the minimalistic look of those websites of old, and wanted to create something similar for myself.
So, here we are.
As such, this website is an active project.
Parts of this site will be perpetually "under construction" as I get new ideas about what to do with it.
I figured a good purpose for this website would be to host my blog and write-ups about some of the interesting projects that I work on.
Hope you find it interesting!</p>
<p>I am an engineer by trade currently working at MathWorks - creators of the computational language MATLAB.</p>
