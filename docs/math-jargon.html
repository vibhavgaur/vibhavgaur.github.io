	<h2>A case for and against mathematical&nbsp;jargon</h2>
	<label>Posted on <strong>August 05, 2021</strong></label>
		
	<p>I frequently find that the biggest obstacle between me and understanding a linear algebra concept is the jargon &#8212; some of it is fairly straightforward like <em>square</em>, <em>invertible</em>, etc. while some of it rather occludes the underlying meaning, such as <em>Hermitian</em>, <em>orthonormal basis</em>, and <em>positive semi-definite</em>. 
I find that these terms usually have a straightforward meaning with regards to a property of the matrix in question, but I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember what the <em>cokernel</em> of a <em>skew-symmetric</em> matrix represents!
This means that I always have to look this up and reason about an explanation for myself before I can actually understand the application of this word in a definition or a&nbsp;proof.</p>
<p>Now, I can also make the case <em>for</em> using jargon &#8212; its a quick and efficient way for experts to transfer knowledge through text and/or speech.
Undoubtedly, in many cases the expansiveness of the subject described (Linear Algebra being a fine example) requires this compression of ideas through jargon.
I think what I&#8217;m really saying is I should suck it up and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/git-gud"><strong>git g&#0252;d</strong></a> at linear&nbsp;algebra.</p>
<p>I guess this is one of the reasons why math outreach is finding such popularity online right now &#8212; because once people cross the hill of jargon, they can truly start to understand the mathematics, which is the satisfing part in the first place.
