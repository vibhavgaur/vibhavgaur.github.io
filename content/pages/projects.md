Title: Projects
Slug: projects

This page contains a number of posts about projects that I have worked on. 
Some posts are simply an explanation of mathematical or scientific concepts that I wanted to learn. 
A very good way to learn things is to try an teach them to someone else. 
Well, I don't have someone to directly teach to, so I shout it out into the void by means of this website:

### Posts (maybe) coming in the future
* Visual odometry on KITTI
* Robot localization
* Optimal Controls project
* Thesis project?
* [Least squares -- solving over and under-determined linear systems](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bkph/articles/Pseudo_Inverse.pdf)
	* Fredholm-Alternative Theorem --> $Ax=b$ has a solution when $b \dot y = 0$, where $A^\*y = 0$
* Topics from Kutz book
	* Singular Value Decomposition 
	* Lagrange polynomials - section 3.2
* Two and three body problems
