* [ ] Fix the issue where the footer overlaps the body content at high zoom levels (and probably even at low zoom levels if there was enough text) -- most likely need to fix the padding in base.css
* [x] Fix the image height issue -- the image should not stretch and squeeze with the text, and the text should wrap around the image
* [x] Make the footer appear at the end of the body content, needs to be done in CSS.

## Hello world!

This website is an experiment that I undertook because I was curious about web development.
I wanted to make a website that had the aesthetic of old websites from around the time the internet was born.
I liked the minimalistic look of those websites of old, and wanted to create something similar for myself.
So, here we are.
As such, this website is an active project.
Parts of this site will be perpetually "under construction" as I get new ideas about what to do with it.
I figured a good purpose for this website would be to host my blog and write-ups about some of the interesting projects that I work on.
Hope you find it interesting!

I am an engineer by trade currently working at MathWorks - creators of the computational language MATLAB.
