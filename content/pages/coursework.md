Title: Coursework


Here is a list of some of the interesting courses I took while at University:

* Estimation and Control of Ground Vehicle Systems

    An advance graduate course focusing on vehicle controls and estimation -- with an emphasis on research advances. 
    This course used model-based control design and estimation techniques to solve problems encountered in real-world situations.

    Some of the topics covered include modeling of vehicle systems (engine, driveline, chassis,  suspension, etc.), designing state estimation algorithms for those models (e.g. Kalman Filters), and designing controllers for various situations and scenarios (e.g. Model Predictive Control). 
    A sample of some of the work done for this course can be read [here](/GVS-Project.html).

* Optimal Control

    some stuff about the optimal control class

* Stochastic Estimation and Control

	Kinda meh

* Time Series Analysis
