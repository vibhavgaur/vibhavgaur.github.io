* $0$ eigenvalues indicate an invariance in some direction of the phase space which means we have an infinite number of choices in that direction -- hence why we can't have a unique solution
* For an over-determined system: You're not actually finding the solution in 2-D space, the solution lies in the subspace of a higher dimensional space. * check this -- I am not sure.
* If the $n$ columns of a square matrix $A$ are independent, they span $\mathbb{R}^n$, so $Ax=b$ is solvable --> because the column space is the whole space, so the system definitely has a solution.
	* if the column space is restricted, then most vectors in the space won't be a solution, only a thin sliver (subspace) will contain the solutions.
	* If the $n$ columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$, they are independent, so $Ax=b$ has only one solution.
