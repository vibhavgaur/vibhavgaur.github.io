I frequently find that the biggest obstacle between me and understanding a linear algebra concept is the jargon -- some of it is fairly straightforward like *square*, *invertible*, etc. while some of it rather occludes the underlying meaning, such as *Hermitian*, *orthonormal basis*, and *positive semi-definite*. 
I find that these terms usually have a straightforward meaning with regards to a property of the matrix in question, but I can't for the life of me remember what the *cokernel* of a *skew-symmetric* matrix represents!
This means that I always have to look this up and reason about an explanation for myself before I can actually understand the application of this word in a definition or a proof.

Now, I can also make the case *for* using jargon -- its a quick and efficient way for experts to transfer knowledge through text and/or speech.
Undoubtedly, in many cases the expansiveness of the subject described (Linear Algebra being a fine example) requires this compression of ideas through jargon.
I think what I'm really saying is I should suck it up and [**git g&#0252;d**](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/git-gud) at linear algebra.

I guess this is one of the reasons why math outreach is finding such popularity online right now -- because once people cross the hill of jargon, they can truly start to understand the mathematics, which is the satisfing part in the first place.
