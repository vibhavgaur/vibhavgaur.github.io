## To do:

* [ ] Figure out a way to format inline code -- there is probably just a language specifier for this.
* [ ] Changing colors randomly from a list in CSS [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25507496/css-change-text-color-randomly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25507496/css-change-text-color-randomly)
* [ ] Make the website available through google search [here](https://victor2code.github.io/blog/2019/07/04/jekyll-github-pages-appear-on-Google.html) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49073043/get-github-pages-site-found-in-google-search-results)
* [ ] Update the correct sitemap for google.
