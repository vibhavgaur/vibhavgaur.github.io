In this project, an optimal tracking (Linear Quadratic Tracker) controller is developed for automatic steering of a vehicle using a DC motor. 
The objective is to track a reference signal for the steering wheel angle (and therefore, the vehicle trajectory) in simulation real-time. 
The vehicle model used is [Automotive Simulation Models](https://www.dspace.com/en/inc/home/products/sw/automotive_simulation_models.cfm) (ASM) by [dSPACE](https://www.dspace.com/en/inc/home.cfm) and the developed controller is shown to improve upon the performance of the in-built driver model.
