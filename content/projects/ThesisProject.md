### Abstract:

The subject of this thesis is the development of an Automatic Steering function on a vehicle driving simulator. A model-free controller based on algebraic derivative estimation is developed to drive the steering wheel motor and therefore implement autonomous driving functionality in the driving simulator. Due to the pandemic of 2020, limited lab access resulted in the inability to tune the implemented controller on the actual system. Presented in this work is a proof-of-concept of the feasibility of such a system, with the final step being the tuning of the implemented controller.
