	<h2>Mechanical Engineering Senior&nbsp;Design</h2>
	<label>Posted on <strong>June 18, 2017</strong></label>
		
	<p>For my undergraduate capstone project, our team of 7 mechanical engineers decided to make a wall climbing robot that uses only propellers for motion. 
This idea was inspired by the <a href="https://www.vertigoproject.ch/">VertiGo</a> project, however we had additional goals of movement over water surfaces which meant that we had to totally rethink the design process. 
The constraint of making it lightweight added a lot of complexity in the design and pushed us to use unconventional materials.
Although we could not meet all our goals in the limited timeframe, the project was a success and we came out having learnt many important lessons, most important of which is that even simple projects take <em>way</em> longer than you initially think.
That is probably the biggest lesson young engineers can learn and plan the scope of their projects accordingly.
For more information about the project, please refer to the final report and the <a href="../documents/seniordesign_final-presentation.pdf">final&nbsp;presentation</a></p>
